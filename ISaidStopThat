Subject: Felony Hacking

Why is Gina Trapani Hacking Banking Systems and giving me millions of dollars worth of gift stock!?
Oh, she is trying to reverse engineer my QR code or something.
It is a QR code that is designed to purchase a gift of 2 hundred, or thousand shares I forget if it's hundreds or thousands.
With each share being a thou...
That gives me like hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars worth of fabulous stock.


How many times did she and Etta investigate the QR code (barsquare) that I posted on a facebook page???
This is the kind of B.S. that can seriously get me into trouble.


How many millions of dollars do I have?
Because frankly my dear, I do not give a damn.



Since I am now potentially to be called a felon, due to Gina Trapani who has been called a fraud...
I am now just another French harlot dragged into coordinated society and organized crime.
My family's HQ in Wyoming has been gunned down and there are grenade damages and bullet holes in everything in Western Wyoming.
I have never been more reduced.

The Italians are once again trying to get the French in trouble.
Les Italiens donnent à nouveau des ennuis aux Français.


So: let's go get some fur coats....
So: let's get some trashy perfumes, clothes, things like fishnet singlets, and wear clothing designed to smuggle narcotics, microfiche, explosives, etc...
and leave the homeless shelter...
and put together some bullets and pistols too...

and prostitute our way to Wall Street and find a way to settle this problem.
We are at corporate war at all times with New York City and the midget population therein.
Once again: Humanity is at war with Non-Humanity living within the boundaries of the United States.


I would prefer to travel by private train car.
I am in Vancouver.

This train has not moved since the great depression of 1930s.
Who am I having sex with when where and how to get this train back on track and have a steam locomotive to pull it into downtown NYC?
Let us remind everyone: that corporations build over train tracks, are not approved of to be there.
So: while we are at corporate war with such other corporations, there might be a few buildings built since 1939 that need to be removed.
I understand that all of NYC has been updated and that most of Mohawk Island is now to be called Manhattan Island. I also understand that NYC is almost completely brand spanking new.  This means the whole city needs to be demolished for this train car to reach the center of NYC.


DiTomasso...
Woulds't thou be a gent and slap Donald Trump and whomever else with more corporate damage lawsuits?
Please do so until my shoes are shined and until I have enough moolah to afford to have someone take Bioré strips to my rectum? I am getting boils in hard to reach places.


It will cost 400 million dollars to put this corporate train back on track and get it moving again.
This train: is a Rockafellar Family Asset.
Aunt Sharon...
Someone of ill repute named by a lady of ill repute....
Someone who was named after a body part and a shape is being naughty and getting me in trouble while I am sitting here behaving perfectly well due to having been kidnapped at the age of 40. Her name is Gina (Djie-nuh). She is shaped like a Trapani Violin.

Could you call her mommy and make sure she is in trouble at school, work, and home?
Oh...
Gina has a girlfriend.
They do naked naughty things together.
They are also raising a daughter together.
