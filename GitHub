I've decided to start putting my reports in GitHub.
It's a website designed for people who write code....
However I never use my account due to my computer having been stolen.


Not only am I multi-lingual, I also know a few computer languages.
This should keep computer illiterate retards off whatever I have to say while lawyers and accountants divvy up paychecks.
It keeps my emails out of litigation and allows us to all go home and stop griping at eachother.
