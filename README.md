There is no special code...
It's more a bunch of mental jibberish from a schizophrenic who cannot stop typing and who goes quite mentally ill if and when the ability to type is nowhere near.


Do keep in mind, that I tend to drive others mentally ill: especially if they read my musings.
They are known to become paranoid, egotistical, neurotic, and some times have huge inferiority complexes.
I do appologize if and when I do damage to someone's delicate psyche.
Which does occur durring psychotic episodes....

We all do have delicate psyches....
